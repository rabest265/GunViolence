## Project Overview

### Gun Violence in the United States

We are interested in investigating the incidents of gun violence in relation to income demographics, firearm provisions by state, active firearm licenses, fatal police shootings and time of year. To demonstrate our findings we will be creating a dashboard with multiple charts and maps that will be updatable with selection controls, possibly including custom D3 charts.
